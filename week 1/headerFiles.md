C++ program should necessarily contain the header file #inlcude<iostream<iostream>>  which stands for input and output stream used to take input with the help of “cin>>” function and display the output using “cout<<” function. 
  The sytax for header is:
  
 #include <filename<filename>>

| file name  | header name| notes|
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
|iostream  | Input Output Stream  | Used as a stream of Input and Output.|
iomanip.h| Input-Output Manipulation  |Used to access set() and setprecision().|
|fstream.h |File stream|Used to control the data to read from a file as an input and data to write into the file as an output.|
|stdio.h | Standard input-output header|Used to perform input and output operations in C like scanf() and printf().|
|string.h |String header|Perform string manipulation operations like strlen and strcpy.|
|conio.h| Console input-output header|Perform console input and console output operations like clrscr() to clear the screen and getch() to get the character from the keyboard.|
|stdlib.h |Standard library header|Perform standard utility functions like dynamic memory allocation, using functions such as malloc() and calloc().|
|math.h |Math header |Perform mathematical operations like sqrt() and pow(). To obtain the square root and the power of a number respectively.|
|ctype.h|Character type header|Perform character type functions like isaplha() and isdigit(). To find whether the given character is an alphabet or a digit respectively.
|time.h|Time header|Perform functions related to date and time like setdate() and getdate(). To modify the system date and get the CPU time respectively.
|assert.h|Assertion header|It is used in program assertion functions like assert(). To get an integer data type in C/C++ as a parameter which prints stderr only if the parameter passed is 0.|
|<ocale.h |Localization header|Perform localization functions like setlocale() and localeconv(). To set locale and get locale conventions respectively.|
|signal.h |Signal header|Perform signal handling functions like signal() and raise(). To install signal handler and to raise the signal in the program respectively|
|setjmp.h |Jump header|Perform jump functions.|
|stdarg.h |Standard argument header|Perform standard argument functions like va_start and va_arg(). To indicate start of the variable-length argument list and to fetch the arguments from the variable-length argument list in the program respectively.|
|errno.h|Error handling header|Used to perform error handling operations like errno(). To indicate errors in the program by initially assigning the value of this function to 0 and then later changing it to indicate errors.|
