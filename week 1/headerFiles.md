C & C++ Headers

1. #include<stdio.h>  (Standard input-output header)

Used to perform input and output operations in C like scanf() and printf().

2. #include<string.h> (String header)

Perform string manipulation operations like strlen and strcpy.

3. #include<conio.h> (Console input-output header)
tabl
Perform console input and console output operations like clrscr() to clear the screen and getch() to get the character from the keyboard.

4. #include<stdlib.h> (Standard library header)

Perform standard utility functions like dynamic memory allocation, using functions such as malloc() and calloc().

5. #include<math.h> (Math header )

Perform mathematical operations like sqrt() and pow(). To obtain the square root and the power of a number respectively.

6. #include<ctype.h>(Character type header)

Perform character type functions like isaplha() and isdigit(). To find whether the given character is an alphabet or a digit respectively.

7. #include<time.h>(Time header)

Perform functions related to date and time like setdate() and getdate(). To modify the system date and get the CPU time respectively.

8. #include<assert.h> (Assertion header)

It is used in program assertion functions like assert(). To get an integer data type in C/C++ as a parameter which prints stderr only if the parameter passed is 0.

9. #include<locale.h> (Localization header)

Perform localization functions like setlocale() and localeconv(). To set locale and get locale conventions respectively.

10. #include<signal.h> (Signal header)

Perform signal handling functions like signal() and raise(). To install signal handler and to raise the signal in the program respectively

11. #include<setjmp.h> (Jump header)

Perform jump functions.

12. #include<stdarg.h> (Standard argument header)

Perform standard argument functions like va_start and va_arg(). To indicate start of the variable-length argument list and to fetch the arguments from the variable-length argument list in the program respectively.

13. #include<errno.h> (Error handling header)

Used to perform error handling operations like errno(). To indicate errors in the program by initially assigning the value of this function to 0 and then later changing it to indicate errors.
