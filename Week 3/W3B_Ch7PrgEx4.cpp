//Write a program that prompts the user to input a string. The program then uses the function substr to remove all the vowels from the string. For example, if str = "There", then after removing all the vowels, str = "Thr". After removing all the vowels, output the string. Your program must contain a function to remove all the vowels and a function to determine whether a character is a vowel.
