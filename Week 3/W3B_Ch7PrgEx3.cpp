//The Programming Example: Pig Latin Strings converts a string into the pig Latin form, but it processes only one word. Rewrite the program so that it can be used to process a text of an unspecified length. If a word ends with a punctuation mark, in the pig Latin form, put the punctuation at the end of the string. For example, the pig Latin form of Hello! is ello-Hay!. Assume that the text con- tains the following punctuation marks: , (comma), . (period), ? (question mark), ; (semicolon), and : (colon). (Your program may store the output in a file.)
