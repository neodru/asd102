/*
Chapter 9 defined the struct studentType to implement 
the basic properties of a student. Define the class studentType
with the same components as the struct studentType, 
and add member functions to manipulate the data members. 
(Note that the data members of the class studentType must be private.) 
Write a program to illustrate how to use the class studentType.
