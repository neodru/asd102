/* In this chapter, the class dateType was designed to implement the date in a program, but the member function setDate and the constructor do not check whether the date is valid before storing the date in the member vari- ables. Rewrite the definitions of the function setDate and the constructor so that the values for the month, day, and year are checked before storing the date into the member variables. Add a member function, isLeapYear, to check whether a year is a leap year. Moreover, write a test program to test your class*/
