/*In Chapter 10, the class clockType was designed to implement the time of day in a program. Certain applications, in addition to hours, minutes, and seconds, might require 
you to store the time zone. Derive the class extClockType from the class clockType by 
adding a member variable to store the time zone.Add the necessary member functions and 
constructors to make the class functional. Also, write the definitions of the member 
functions and the constructors. Finally, write a test program to test your class.*/
