To make telephone numbers easier to remember, some companies use letters to show their telephone number. For example, using letters, the telephone number 438-5626 can be shown as GET LOAN. In some cases, to make a telephone number meaningful, companies might use more than seven letters. For example, 225-5466 can be displayed as CALL HOME,whichuseseightletters.Writeaprogramthatpromptsthe user to enter a telephone number expressed in letters and outputs the corresponding telephone number in digits.
