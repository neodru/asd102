Suppose that sale and bonus are double variables. Write an if...else 
statement that assigns a value to bonus as follows: If sale is greater
than $20,000, the value assigned to bonus is 0.10, that is 10%; If sale
is greater than $10,000 and less than or equal to $20,000, the value
assigned to bonus is 0.05, that is 5%; otherwise the value assigned to
bonus is 0, that is 0%. (3)
