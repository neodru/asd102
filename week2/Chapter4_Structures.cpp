And                         &&      Compares two boolean expressions. 
                                    Both must be true for the whole to 
                                    be true. Everything else is false.
Or                          ||      Compares two boolean expressions. 
                                    Both must be false for the whole 
                                    to be false. Everything else is true.
Not                         !       Returns the opposite result of an 
                                    evaluated boolean expression.
